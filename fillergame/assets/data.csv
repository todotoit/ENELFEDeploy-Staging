We're building smart grids that are as intelligent as the Internet, grids that analyze consumption data in real time, manage distribution, transport renewable energy without limits and enable entirely new services for people, businesses and cities.

Next-generation smart meters let homeowners know exactly how much energy they're using so they can optimize their energy consumption. Improving digital technology helps them transform their houses into smart homes, where thermostats learn when you are at home, fridges cool when energy is cheapest, and lights switch off if no one is in the room.

Urban areas consume up to 80% of global electricity and are responsible for most of greenhouse emissions.

enabling new services for citizens, are the key urban infrastructure able to support the inception of future cities – digital, shared, sustainable.

A Smart Grid is an electricity network improved with ICT solutions able to integrate actions of all actors (producers, regulators, consumers) in order to enable an efficient and resilient electricity delivery.

A Smart City is built and developed upon platforms to enable new services and innovative functions, and it has to combine economic growth with environmental protection and social inclusion, digitalization with energy efficiency. The main challenge of a Smart City is a cost effective and sustainable urban flows management: energy, water, waste and transportation",Bird on electricity cables

E-cars beyond mobility. The technologies that enable the use of electricity as a ‘fuel’ for vehicles and means of transportation raise the bar of innovation by turning e-cars and recharge systems into small power plants and micro distribution grids. What makes this possible is Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)

In fact, the V2G technology enables the integration of e-cars into the electricity grid, thus optimising the green energy flows that originate from small renewable plants spread throughout the area.

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) system, which will allow electric vehicles to operate as actual ""energy hubs"", with the ability to use, store or easily return electricity to the grid, by using new technologies to manage bidirectional charging, both while driving and at charging stations.

V2G technology integrates electric vehicles into the power grid, thus optimising the use of “clean energy” from small renewable energy plants throughout the area. If surplus energy (compared to the needs of the power grid) is produced at a given moment in a certain area, electric vehicles can be used as a storage system in order to reuse the energy when necessary. Users can charge their car batteries at times in which energy prices and demand are lower, and then use the stored electricity or sell it to the grid during peak hours with higher prices.

Four-wheel mobile plants
Electric cars that can store clean energy and inject it into the grid to power the daily life of our cities. It’s not a futuristic project, but rather the result of a revolution that Enel is making possible with the Vehicle 2 Grid (V2G) project.

In France, for instance, where 38 million cars are driving and the current electricity generation is 130 GW, in a future in which all vehicles will be electric or hybrid, integration between the grid and vehicles will be able to generate the equivalent of a 380 GW virtual electric plant (three times the present generation capacity).",Man charging/giving energy to home

Enel’s strategy for reducing energy consumption envisages investment to increase
efficiency in all the Group’s activities, from production to distribution,
and also aims to disseminate greater awareness in consumption.
For Enel, using energy efficiently means three things:
> maximizing the efficiency on the generation mix in order to reduce as far as
possible the energy dispersed in production;
> improving the distribution network in order to prevent significant quantities
of energy being lost along power lines and encouraging the development of
smart grids;
> promoting efficiency in final uses.
